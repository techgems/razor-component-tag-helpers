# Razor Component Tag Helpers

Razor Component Tag Helpers is a one file ASP.NET Core library that allows you to write UI components while maintaining compatibility with Razor Pages and MVC.

- [Documentation](https://razor-components.techgems.net/)
- [Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TechGems.RazorComponentTagHelpers)

## Name change

The nuget package for this library was previously called `TechGems.TagHelperComponents`, but since [Tag Helper Components](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/th-components?view=aspnetcore-6.0) are a different concept in ASP.NET Core, I decided to rename the library to Razor Component Tag Helpers.
